Component folder (app/components)

- Place shared and page-specific React components here.
- Prefer small, focused components (Button, Card, Avatar) under `ui/`.
- Export higher-level components from `app/components/index.js` when useful.

Example structure:
 - app/components/
   - ui/
     - Button.jsx
   - Header.jsx
   - Footer.jsx
   - index.js
